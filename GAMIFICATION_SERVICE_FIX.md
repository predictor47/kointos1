# 🎮 GamificationService Registration Fix

## ❌ **Issue Identified**
```
Bad state: GetIt: Object/factory with type GamificationService is not registered inside GetIt.
```

## ✅ **Root Cause**
The `GamificationService` was being used throughout the application but was not registered in the service locator (`service_locator.dart`).

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### **1. Added Import**
```dart
import 'package:kointos/core/services/gamification_service.dart';
```

### **2. Registered Service**
```dart
serviceLocator.registerLazySingleton<GamificationService>(
  () => GamificationService(serviceLocator<ApiService>()),
);
```

## 📋 **Files Using GamificationService**
- `real_portfolio_screen.dart` - User stats display
- `real_leaderboard_screen.dart` - Leaderboard and rankings  
- `game_stats_widget.dart` - Game statistics widget
- `real_social_feed_screen.dart` - Point awards for social actions
- `real_articles_screen.dart` - Points for reading articles

## 🎯 **GameActions Supported**
- `createPost` (10 points)
- `likePost` (2 points)  
- `commentOnPost` (5 points)
- `sharePost` (3 points)
- `publishArticle` (25 points)
- `readArticle` (1 point)
- `correctPrediction` (15 points)
- `streakBonus` (5 points)
- `dailyLogin` (5 points)
- `profileComplete` (50 points)
- `firstFollow` (10 points)

## ✅ **Validation**
- ✅ `flutter analyze` - No issues found
- ✅ `flutter pub get` - Dependencies resolved
- ✅ `flutter build web --debug` - Build successful
- ✅ Service registration complete

## 🚀 **Result**
The application now properly initializes the `GamificationService` through dependency injection, eliminating the GetIt registration error. All gamification features (points, levels, achievements, leaderboards) should now work correctly.
