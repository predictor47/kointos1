# 🎯 **COMPLETE ANSWER: Bedrock Permissions & Query Flow**

## 🔐 **How to Ensure Amplify App Has Bedrock Permissions**

### ✅ **Step 1: Backend IAM Configuration (DONE)**
Your `amplify/backend.ts` already includes:
```typescript
const bedrockPolicy = new Policy(stack, 'BedrockPolicy', {
  statements: [
    new PolicyStatement({
      effect: Effect.ALLOW,
      actions: [
        'bedrock:InvokeModel',
        'bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream',
      ],
      resources: [
        `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`,
        // ... other Claude models
      ],
    }),
  ],
});

// Attached to authenticated users
backend.auth.resources.authenticatedUserIamRole.attachInlinePolicy(bedrockPolicy);
```

### 🚀 **Step 2: Deploy Backend**
```bash
npx ampx sandbox
# Wait for deployment to complete
```

### 🎛️ **Step 3: Enable Models in AWS Console**
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/
2. Click "Model access" (left sidebar)
3. Click "Edit" or "Manage model access"
4. Enable: **Claude 3 Haiku** (anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0)
5. Submit request (usually auto-approved)

### 🧪 **Step 4: Test Integration**
Use the `BedrockPermissionChecker` widget I created:
```dart
// Add to your app for testing
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => const BedrockPermissionChecker(),
));
```

## 🔄 **Complete Query Processing Flow**

### **Phase 1: User Input → Context Gathering**
```
User types: "Should I buy Bitcoin?"
    ↓
Chatbot captures input
    ↓
KointosAIChatbotService.processMessage()
    ↓
LLMService.generateResponse() starts
```

### **Phase 2: Real-Time Data Collection** 
```
┌─ 1. User Profile (Amplify GraphQL)
│   └── XP: 2450, Level: Gold, Sentiment: 15 bullish/8 bearish
│
├─ 2. Market Data (CoinGecko API) ← YES, REAL-TIME! 🔥
│   └── Bitcoin: $67,834.50 (+2.45%), Market Cap: $1.34T
│
└─ 3. Article History (ArticleRepository)
    └── Recent: "DeFi Summer 2.0: What to Expect"

### **Phase 4: Bedrock API Execution**
```
1. Get Cognito credentials
   └── AWS temporary keys from authenticated session

2. AWS Signature V4 signing
   └── HMAC-SHA256 signed headers for security

3. HTTPS POST to Bedrock Runtime API
   └── https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
       model/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0/invoke

4. Claude 3 Haiku processes contextual prompt
   └── Uses real market data + user profile for personalization

5. AI generates intelligent response
   └── 200-300 words, contextually relevant
```

### **Phase 5: Response & Storage**
```
Claude Response:
"🚀 Looking at Bitcoin's current momentum at $67,834 with +2.45% 
gains, combined with your Gold-level experience and bullish 
sentiment history (15 vs 8 bearish votes), the timing could be
