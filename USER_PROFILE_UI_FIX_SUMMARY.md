# User Profile Display & Social Features Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Profile Screen Display Issue**
**Problem**: The profile screen was failing to display user names and profile information due to constructor conflicts in the `UserProfile` class.

**Root Cause**: The `profile_screen.dart` was trying to create `UserProfile` objects using a direct constructor with parameters like `userId`, `displayName`, etc., but the local `UserProfile` class expected different parameters like `id`, `fullName`, etc.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the `_loadUserData()` method in `profile_screen.dart` to consistently use the `UserProfile.fromApi()` factory method
- This ensures proper data mapping between API response and the local UserProfile class structure

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/presentation/screens/profile_screen.dart`
- `test/profile_screen_userprofile_test.dart` (created to verify fix)

### 2. **Social Features "UserProfile not found" Error**
**Problem**: When users tried to like posts or comment, they received "UserProfile not found" errors, preventing social interactions.

**Root Cause**: The `GamificationService` was calling `_apiService.getUserProfile()` directly to award points for social actions (likes, comments). If the user profile didn't exist in the database, this would throw an exception and block the action.

**Solution**:
- Modified `GamificationService` to use `UserProfileInitializationService` instead of direct API calls
- This ensures that if a user profile doesn't exist when trying to award points, it gets created automatically
- The service now gracefully handles cases where profiles need to be initialized

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/core/services/gamification_service.dart`
- `test/gamification_fix_verification_test.dart` (created to verify fix)

## Technical Details

### Profile Screen Fix
```dart
// Before (causing errors):
_userProfile = UserProfile(
  userId: currentUser,
  displayName: userProfileData['displayName'],
  // ... other mismatched parameters
);

// After (working correctly):
_userProfile = UserProfile.fromApi(userProfileData, {
  'userId': currentUser,
  'username': userProfileData['username'] ?? 'User',
  'email': userProfileData['email'] ?? '',
  'displayName': userProfileData['displayName'] ?? 'User',
});
```

### Gamification Service Fix
```dart
// Before (failing when profile doesn't exist):
final currentProfile = await _apiService.getUserProfile(userId);
if (currentProfile == null) {
  throw Exception('User profile not found');
}

// After (creates profile if needed):
final currentProfile = await _profileService.getCurrentUserProfile();
if (currentProfile == null) {
  LoggerService.error('Failed to get or create user profile');
  throw Exception('User profile not found');
}
```

## Test Results
- ✅ `UserProfile.fromApi()` method works correctly with both API data and fallback scenarios
- ✅ `UserProfile.guest()` method creates proper guest profiles
- ✅ Gamification service compiles successfully with the new profile initialization integration
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved while fixing the specific issues

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Profile Display**: Users should now see their names and profile information correctly in the profile tab
2. **Social Interactions**: Users should be able to like posts and comment without getting "UserProfile not found" errors
3. **Automatic Profile Creation**: If a user's profile doesn't exist when they perform social actions, it will be created automatically
4. **Gamification**: Points will be awarded properly for social actions without blocking the user experience

## Files Created for Testing
- `test/profile_screen_userprofile_test.dart`: Tests UserProfile factory methods
- `test/gamification_fix_verification_test.dart`: Verifies gamification service fixes
