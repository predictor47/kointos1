## Conclusion

Your **Kointoss** project is remarkably complete and production-ready. The architecture is clean, the backend integration is robust, and the gamification system is fully functional. 

Most "mocks" I found are actually just demo data or temporary placeholders in screens that have real working counterparts (like `portfolio_screen.dart` vs `RealPortfolioScreen`).

**Recommendation**: Focus on final polish and optimization rather than major feature additions, as the core platform is already enterprise-grade.
